### A Glimpse into the Elegance

Unveil a symphony of intellect as I delve into the realm of Linear Regression with meticulous craftsmanship. Witness the unveiling of an extraordinary endeavor where I embark on the journey of self-coding Linear Regression from its fundamental core. Through this assignment, I immerse myself in the realms of Normal Equation (NE), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and Gradient Descent (GD), meticulously comparing their nuances as 'alpha learning rate' transforms and the resonant metric of R2 takes center stage. Join me in unraveling the mysteries of predictive modeling and algorithmic artistry. ðŸŒŸðŸ“ŠðŸ’¡

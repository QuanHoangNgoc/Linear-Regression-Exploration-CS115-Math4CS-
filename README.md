### A Dazzling Glimpse of Elegance

Prepare to witness a captivating performance of intellect as I venture into the enchanting world of Linear Regression with meticulous artistry. Behold the unveiling of an extraordinary odyssey where I immerse myself in the sacred craft of self-coding Linear Regression from its very essence. Within this scholarly pursuit, I traverse the realms of Normal Equation (NE), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and Gradient Descent (GD), meticulously dissecting their subtleties amidst the transformative dance of the 'alpha learning rate' and the melodic resonance of the R2 metric taking the spotlight. Join me on this expedition into the enigmatic realm of predictive modeling and the exquisite tapestry of algorithmic craftsmanship. ðŸŒŸðŸ“ŠðŸ’¡
